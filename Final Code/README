The following features are fully implemented.
=============================================
* Shell built-ins: echo, cd, pwd, export
* Multi-level piping
* I/O redirection
* History and ! 
   + Just like bash, if any comand is preceeded by space, it won't be logged into the history.
   + Just like bash, if any extra string is following the !! command, it will be appended to the target command.
   	  e.g., My most recent executed command is 'ls'.
   	  		Then '!!'' 		will execute 'ls'
   	  			 '!! -l'	will execute 'ls -l'
   	  			 '!! -1 '	will execute 'ls -1'
* Signal handeling ( Ctrl+C )


Pending:
========
* &, fg
* Parsing the strings/arguments containing quotes and spaces.
